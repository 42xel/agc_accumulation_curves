\section {universality}
\label{sec:universality}
Techniques, ad hoc or general (Iran paper) can be employed to make more general agc machines capable of simulating whole classes of lbss\_agc machines each.

One can only do so much though, a priori, there is no universal linear Turing machine, the most one can do is universal for a set of multiplicative constants, much like agc machine can only be universal for a set of meta-signal speeds.
Emphasis on "a priori" since simulating is a fuzzy concept arbitrarily defined and I haven't dug deep into it.
