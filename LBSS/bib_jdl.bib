                  bounded space and time using instance-specific

                  machine deploys the Map/Reduce paradigm over a
                  discrete fractal structure. Moreover our approach is
                  modular\string: the machine is constructed by combining
                  modules. In this manner, we can easily create
                  generic machines for solving satifiability variants,

                  according to their colors.  Time and space are
                  continuous and accumulations can be devised to
                  unlimitedly accelerate a computation and provide, in

  abstract = {Abstract geometrical computation naturally arises as a
                  continuous counterpart of cellular automata. It
                  relies on signals (dimensionless points) traveling
                  at constant speed in a continuous space in
                  continuous time. When signals collide, they are
                  replaced by new signals according to some collision
                  rules. This simple dynamics relies on real numbers
                  with exact precision and is already known to be able
                  to carry out any (discrete) Turing-computation. The
                  Blum, Shub and Smale (BSS) model is famous for
                  computing over \RealSet (considered here as a
                  \RealSet unlimited register machine) by performing
                  algebraic computations.  \par We prove that signal
                  machines (set of signals and corresponding rules)
                  and the infinite-dimension linear (multiplications

                  computation (MCU '04, LNCS 3354), the author

                  the black hole model. \par We prove here that

                  by reducing the problem of deciding whether a
                  recursive function (represented by a 2-counter
                  automaton) is strictly partial. The
