\section{Intro}

This doc describe various models related to computation in discrete steps on real variables.
Then it expends on one that I'll use for AGC.


\section{Computation in a Ring}
\TODO{frame my goal in the bigger picture of ring computation}

From now on, $\RealSet$ is the set of real numbers, with it's usual ring structure and order.

\FRIDGE{$\mathcal{R}$ is a commutative ring with a unit and an order, typically $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$}
