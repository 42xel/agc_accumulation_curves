%TODO rewrite, move or remove.
%\section{Technical Compiler and Interpreter part (Python)}
%
%\emph{Language:}
%Python.
%
%Simple to use, I don't really need more.
%
%Other candidates were Ruby and Lua, for rational expression.
%Ruby I don't know.
%Lua I love, but for this purpose, the difference with python is lesser popularity and no structure other than tables.
%
%String processing library-ies?
%RE
%
%\subsection{main program}
%Goal: identify what file has to be loaded, what string has to be read...
%Then what to interpret, what to compile and how.
%
%Presumably, it will be pattern search (<<< should allow to avoid good parenthesis, but is not an issue if needed).
%
%The lists of whats to identify:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item machine definition (file or string). A python object (dico?) has to be built.
%	\item configuration definition (file or string). A python object (dico) has to be built.
%	\item interpreting a machine. Has to be done in python (feed relevant dico to a function)
%	\item compiling something. python object to feed to a function that writes in an agc file
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{initial configuration loader}
%The string is interpreted as python code, and ought to define either a list (the tape)
%or a dictionary with a field "tape" (a list of numbers), a field "accumulator" (the initial accumulator value) and a field "initial\_state" (a string), all optional.
%
%The loader transforms it into a dic with all fields filled, to be used by the interpreter or the loader.
%
%\subsection{interpreter}
%graphic library or full text (console/ log file)?
%Full text.
